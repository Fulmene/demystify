Demystify
A Magic: The Gathering Parser

1) ABOUT

Demystify is an attempt to make it possible for a computer to understand what
general Magic: The Gathering cards do. It is currently written in a combination
of ANTLR 3.4 and Python 3.2.

2) INSTALLATION

Demystify depends on the following libraries and/or programs, which you will
need to have installed in order to build the parser and run Demystify.
See INSTALL for more specific instructions.

- Java 1.6.0 (or later)
- ANTLR 3.4.1 (or later 3.4 release)
- ANTLR 3 Python3 runtime [experimental, available at github.com/Zannick/antlr3]
- jpackage-utils 1.7.5 (or later)
- Python 3.2
- python-progressbar 2.3

3) BUILDING

To build the parser generator, you need to have the macro.g and Words.g grammar
files up-to-date. If they don't exist, or demystify/keywords.py has changed,
run
    $ python3 demystify/keywords.py
to regenerate them.

Then, you need to run antlr3 on the grammar. If you've followed the instructions
in INSTALL and gotten yourself an antlr3 script, all you need to do is:
    $ cd demystify/grammar/
    $ antlr3 Demystify.g
If not, your commandline will look something like this (supposing your classpath
is properly set):
    $ cd demystify/grammar/
    $ java org.antlr.Tool Demystify.g
(Note that cd instruction; if you "antlr3 demystify/grammar/Demystify.g"
 instead, you'll get the .py output files where they belong, but the .tokens
 files are put in your working directory.)

This takes a little while.

If it worked (and it worked if all the output you received were of the form
"warning(138): ... no start rule ...", and not "error(12345)" etc.),
demystify/grammar/ should now contain a series of Demystify*.py
files. These will be used by the main demystify.py script.

If it doesn't work, and you're sure you installed antlr3 and java correctly,
check that you followed instructions in INSTALL again. If antlr3 is actually
giving grammar errors, please check the Issues tab in github for the issue
or file a new bug.

4) RUNNING

The main entry point is the demystify.py script in the demystify/ folder.
It currently offers three modes of running:

load

Loads the card data from demystify/data/text/ and performs preprocessing steps
necessary before any lexing and parsing is done. With -i, opens an interactive
prompt afterward, at which functions in demystify.py and card.py can be called.
This is useful for actually invoking the parser, as well as doing special card
searches using the utility functions in card.py.

test

Runs the tests (or a specific test) in demystify/tests/.

update

Mainly a convenience function for me, this grabs card data from Gatherer, fixes
some textual oddities, and saves the results in demystify/data/text/. Please
don't overrun Wizards's servers. :)

These can be run from within demystify with:
    $ python3 demystify.py load -i

Add -h or --help for more information:
    $ python3 demystify.py -h
    $ python3 demystify.py test -h

5) MISCELLANEOUS

Dependency visualization:

The deps/deps.py script reads the grammar files and outputs to stdout a
dot format graph file, which describes how parser rules in the grammar call
other parser rules, as well as how the grammar files reference other grammar
files. You'll want to use graphviz's dot program to visualize this, e.g. with:
    $ python3 deps/deps.py | dot -Tpng -o gdeps.png

graphviz can be installed via your package management tool, or downloaded from
http://www.graphviz.org.

Are welcome! Please use github forks and pull requests. Bugs without fixes can
be reported as well.

7) LICENSE AND DISCLAIMER

The files in this repository fall into four categories:
    A) antlr3/antlr3
    B) Python code in demystify/ and ANTLRv3 code in demystify/grammar/
    C) deps/deps.py
    D) Card data in demystify/data/ and demystify/tests/

(A) is based on the antlr3 script that was installed on one of my machines
when I installed ANTLRv3 via yum. It is therefore (to the best of my
knowledge) covered until ANTLRv3's license (BSD),
which is included as antlr3/LICENSE.

(B) is the Demystify program itself, and the core of this repository. It
is licensed under the Lesser GNU Public License version 3. See COPYING
for the GPL v3 and COPYING.LESSER for the LGPL v3.

(C) is also licensed under the LGPL v3 but it is not a part of Demystify
(though it runs by reading parts of Demystify) which is why I've set it apart.

(D) consists of Magic: The Gathering card data, in the form of full card
records, slightly modified to fix errors (data/), or in the form of test cases,
which may include actual card rules or possible card rules. All card
information is copyrighted by Wizards of the Coast.

Demystify is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

8) THANKS

Thanks go to Terence Parr and the ANTLR project (without which this project
would be much more difficult), and to Wizards of the Coast (for making
Magic: The Gathering, without which this project would not exist).
